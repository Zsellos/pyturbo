# pyTurbo

`pyTurbo` is a library for turbomachinery simulation.

This project primarilly focuses on learning how components and assemblies of turbomachinery parts are interacting during operation but also how they are designed together.

Note: the modelings are simplified/simplistic, they do **not** match precision expectations for industrial use.
